Welcome to the ZZZ Damage Calculator!

This calculator is relatively simple in that that the total DMG is focused only on one agent (like a DPS-Support-Support team). This means that buffs from supporting agents are calculated into the total DMG, as well as from ENEMY states (whether they are STUNNED, SHREDDED, or any other debuffs toggled).

Hopefully we will be able to mess with the ENEMY's states, or else we will have to rely only on raw TOTAL DMG acquired from both the DPS and buffs from supports.
